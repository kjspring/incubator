Propose a project. Motivate the problem you are tackling, discuss the data source(s) you are using, and explain the the analysis you are performing. Do enough exploratory data analysis to convince the project is viable and to generate two interesting non-trivial plots. Explain them and give url links to those plots.

With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act beneficial outcomes of patient care and preventive medicine will be a significant source of income for hospitals and reduction of payments from health insurance companies. Studies have shown that use of oral contraceptives has a reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer [source](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/oral-contraceptives). By determining the factors of women that do not to take contraceptives, these women can be predicted and targeted to use contraceptives so that ovarian and endometrial cancer can be prevented.

The Contraceptive Method Choice [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice) complied from 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence [Survey](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/2483) can be used to create a machine learning classifier to predict which women will use no contraceptives. The factors in the survey are wife's age, wife's education, husband's education, religiosity, wife's employment, husband's employment, wealth, media exposure, and contraceptive use.

As shown in [Figure 1](http://) education seems to play an important role in contraceptive use. Direct targeting through the media may not be enough to prusuade women to use contraceptives as [Figure 2](http://) shows that media use is the high in all contraceptive use groups. Access to healthcare is an important factor as indicated in [Figure 3](http://) but will be nullified as lower income groups get access to primary care physicians through the Affordable Care Act.

My analysis uses decision tree forests to learn the factors that influence contraceptive use in women. While the current model only accurately predicts 22% of long term and 42% of short term uses of contraceptives, the model does accurately predicts 60% of women that do not use contraceptives in the testing data set. With more data that includes the type of doctor or hospital these women visit, a more targeted marketing approach through healthcare workers could increase the use of contraceptives.
